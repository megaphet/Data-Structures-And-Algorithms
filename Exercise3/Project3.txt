 Project 3
 Stack Questions:
 • Practical (Rwanda): In a MoMo Pay transaction, push ["Enter Amount", "Enter 
PIN", "Confirm"]. Pop once to cancel. Which step remains at top?
 • Practical (Rwanda): A student records revision topics: push ["Math", "English", 
"ICT"]. Pop once and push "Biology". What is the current top?
 • Challenge: Show how a stack can validate balanced brackets for (2+3)*(4-1).
 • Reflection: Why do many apps use stacks for undo features instead of queues?
 Queue Questions:
 • Practical (Rwanda): In a UR library, students queue to borrow books. After 3 
join and 1 is served, who remains at the front?
 • Practical (Rwanda): At Airtel service center, 6 customers request SIM swaps. 
Who will be the 2nd served?
 • Challenge: Compare performance of linear vs circular queue in a bus ticketing 
system. Which is more efficient?
• Reflection: Why do queues better model fairness in everyday Rwanda services 
like banking and transport?
